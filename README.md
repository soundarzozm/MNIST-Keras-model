# MNIST Keras Model using CNN

This is a deep learning project based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using Keras and the MNIST dataset.
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 photographs of digits 0-9. This model outputs the number on the given photograph.

## Getting Started

The Jupyter Notebook holds the model along with a simple guide throughout the code.

### Prerequisites



```
Python
```
```
Keras functions
```
```
MNIST Dataset
```
```
GPU or TPU (Not compulsory)
```

## Deployment

Use Google Colaboratory or a Jupyter Notebook for better control over the execution of the model.
Note that Google Colab provides dedicated GPU and TPU from the Google servers.
